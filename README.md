# instagram-clone

This instagram clone that I built using react to consolidate my learning of several new technologies I was getting familiar with, among which I highlight tailwind. I found tailwind even more incredible, easy, and fun, than working with styled components. The documentation of Tailwind is a real marvel, it is in itself a masterclass of ui ux.
However, the most important and interesting of the new technologies I implemented on this project was TypeScript, I highly doubt that TypeScript wonâ€™t be part of my projects from now on!

## Features
